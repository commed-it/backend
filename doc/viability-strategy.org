#+TITLE: Viability Strategy
* PROJ Geet a viability strategy
** Who
+ Geographically
  - Catalonia, LLeida is to small to test the subject, but maybe be could start only with BCN Lleida-TRG
  - LLEIDA-TRG seems good to us. Diversity seems to be better there.
+ Multi Single sector: multisector. No discuss.
+ Size of organizations: we will targe them all. Small medium to start. 2nd 3rd year we will focus on the big ones.
  - Diferent plans to target them.
  - Subscription based on the enterprise directly.
+ Interest
  - Quim :: Publishers may want both ends of the stick.
  - Sergi :: Getting a small ecosystem.
** How Many
+ Periods
  - like we said before, we should target small and medium first, but by the second year and incrementally focus on big companies.
+ Per sector
  - First sectors
    + Food Industry
    + Restauration
    + Agriculture :: pick food
    + Organitzations for seasonal work to get temporary contracts (?)
  - Second sector (you may have already a prefered source)
    + Security
    + Cleaning Services
    + Logistic
+ Per customer type
  - Focus on workable ecosystems
** Strategy
+ Marketing campaings
  - Nico & Quim :: LINKEDIN BOOOOIS, social media
+ Ads :: Wix seems to have paid off
  - They are not expensive, maybe in Linkedin we could get money.
+ Door to door / Demos
  - Sergi :: Seems a good way to get the first clients, even if we have to make a give away
  - Quim :: Slush and other congress.
+ Word-to-mouth
  - Friendship partnerships, as in gyms.
** PROJ MONEY-GRABBERS BOOOOOOOOOOYS
*** Mixed strategy
- If it is free user and you want only to search one service/product, it has limited features, such as: limited search, limited capacity of companies to chat and connect and also, it has to pay a fixed contract.
- If it is a subscribed user, it could pay:
  - A % fee depending a contract (legal issues) if you are a big company?
  - Fixed payment with less %?
  - Limited amount of contracts of that price?
  - Not payment if you are a small company?
- Support a free trial with limited features but not as free user functionalities?
*** Upfront fee
- Free trial.
  + First commercial agreement is free.
  + Comision on the agreement.
- Freemium :: We may base it on freemium.
  + Chating - You can only have N chats
- Free :: Search for business
  + Searcher
- Premium :: Starts the chat
  + Publishing
  + Sign the contract
*** TODO Subscription model
+ Weekly
+ Monthly
+ Annualy
  - Sergi :: proposed to break the prices between small, medium and large enterprises. Maybe make a sale at some point to get more users
  - Quim :: proposed ...
  - Ori :: Same as Sergi.
  - Emina :: ..
  - Jas ::  ..
  - Nico :: ..
*** TODO Advertising
*** TODO In-App purchases
+ The entities must pay a % of the contract / formal offer they have agreed
+
** TODO Three scenarios
+ Pessimistic
+ Normal
+ Optimistic
** TODO That variables that played for us
